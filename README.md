# odinprojectjavascriptpractice
My solutions to the [javascript practice project from The Odin Project.](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises) My introduction to test-driven development using Jasmine. Demonstrating familiarity with simple looping logic, arrays, working with floating numbers, and functions with multiple optional arguments.

## Demonstrated Skills
This project is a result of my study of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com). This project features the following skills, but includes many more:

- Test-driven development
- Working with functions with multiple optional arguments
- Simple looping and if/then logic
- Arrays and array manipulation
- Working with floating numbers
- Using modulus to solve problems
- Basic error handling

## Solved Problems
By following the instructions during the course, not all problems featured in this project have been solved yet. These are the those that are:

helloWorld: Introduction to test-driven development. Submits a hello world parameter to a test spec file.

leapYears: Accepts an inputted year and determines if it is a leap year using a given ruleset.

removeFromArray: Accepts an array and any number of items to remove from said array, using optional multiple arguments. Removes requested items from the submitted array.

sumAll: Takes two numbers, finds the lowest, and adds every number until it reaches the highest. Also includes basic error handling.

repeatString: Takes two parameters - a string to repeat and the number of times it needs to be repeated. Concatenates string together requested number of times. Basic error handling included.

tempConversion: Converts farenheit to celsius and vice versa. Multiple functions. Using simple math and handling floating numbers.

reverseString: Reverses a submitted string. Accepts a string, puts each character into an array, pops off the last character and concatenates it onto a string to reverse it.

## Getting Started
Each solution has its own folder. The README.md of each solution is the same as that of the original project - these were my instructions as I came up with solutions. Summaries of each solution are above. Please note that not all available solutions have been solved. I have solved those instructed of me by The Odin Project lessons.

If you are new to the technologies listed below, you can familiarize yourself with them through [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) like I have, or click the links below for each technology.
